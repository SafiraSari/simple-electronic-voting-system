# simple-electronic-voting-system
> This program simulates a voting system in Java - Simple Electronic Voting System (SEVS). The user will be able to create their list of candidates, view the list of candidates, vote, and display the results of the vote.

## Entering Candidates
At the start of the program, the user will be prompted to enter a string of the candidate's ID and their full name, seperated by a comma. Each candidate is seperated by a semi-colon. It is thus formateed in such that their names are capitalized with proper spacing. You can therefore input something such as the following:
```
     11, jaNE DoE;   12,JohN Doe  ; 10,TanGO   ZULu;   15,sierra romeo
```

## Capabilities
A menu will appear, allowing the user to select an option.
- 1   >> Display candidates
- 2   >> Vote a candidate
- 3   >> Add new candidate(s) 
- 4   >> Display results
- 0   >> End SEVS
